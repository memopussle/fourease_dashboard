# How to run the project locally

## Run front-end folder

```bash
# start localhost:3000 
npm start 
```

## Run back-end folder 

1. Run the app without using docker

```bash
# Run server.ts
npm run dev
```

2. Run the app using docker

```bash
# Include --build to rebuild the container
docker compose up --build 

# Run this command below if you're sure that your container is up to date
docker compose up
```

3. Server runs on `localhost:8080` without Docker, or server runs on `localhost:8090` with Docker
